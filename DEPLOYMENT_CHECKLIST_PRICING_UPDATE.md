## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Vercel Environment Variables

```

### 3. Verify Vercel Deployment

1. **Wait for deployment to complete** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Check deployment logs** in Vercel Dashboard
3. **Verify build succeeded** (green checkmark)

### 4. Post-Deployment Testing

#### Homepage (https://callwaitingai.dev)
- [ ] Hero section shows "$20 for 120 voice minutes"
- [ ] Pricing section displays 4 tiers (Starter, Pro, Enterprise, Custom)
- [ ] "Most Popular" badge on Pro plan
- [ ] All payment links work (open in new tab to Flutterwave)
- [ ] FAQ section mentions per-minute pricing
- [ ] Mobile responsive (test on iPhone/Android)

#### Upgrade Page (https://callwaitingai.dev/dashboard/upgrade)
- [ ] 3 pricing tiers displayed correctly
- [ ] Payment links redirect to Flutterwave
- [ ] Value props show (Rollover, 24/7, $0 Setup)
- [ ] FAQ section loads
- [ ] Ada phone number clickable: +1 (415) 687-6510
- [ ] Mobile responsive

#### Billing Page (https://callwaitingai.dev/billing)
- [ ] Tiers show USD pricing ($20, $80, $180)
- [ ] Current plan indicator works
- [ ] Upgrade buttons functional

#### API Testing
Test payment link generation:
```bash
# Login to dashboard first, then:
curl -X POST https://callwaitingai.dev/api/create-payment-link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"plan": "starter"}' \
  --cookie "your-session-cookie"

# Should return:
# {"paymentLink": "https://flutterwave.com/...", "txRef": "cw_..."}
```

### 5. Flutterwave Verification

Check Flutterwave Dashboard:
- [ ] Webhook endpoint configured: `/api/flutterwave-webhook`
- [ ] Secret hash matches `FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HASH`
- [ ] Payment links active and accessible
- [ ] Test payment with test card (if available)

### 6. Analytics & Monitoring

Enable tracking for:
- [ ] Pricing page views (`/dashboard/upgrade`)
- [ ] CTA clicks ("Get Starter", "Get Pro", etc.)
- [ ] Flutterwave redirects
- [ ] Payment completions

**Plausible/Google Analytics Events:**
```javascript
// Track pricing tier selection
trackEvent('Pricing Tier Selected', {
  plan: 'starter|pro|enterprise',
  source: 'homepage|dashboard'
})

// Track payment initiation
trackEvent('Payment Initiated', {
  plan: 'starter|pro|enterprise',
  amount: 20|80|180
})
```

### 7. Database Verification

Check Supabase `subscriptions` table:
```sql
-- Verify new plans are being recorded
SELECT plan, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(amount) as avg_amount
FROM subscriptions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY plan;

-- Check for any failed payments
SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
WHERE status = 'failed'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

### Quick Rollback (Vercel)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Find previous deployment (before this change)
3. Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Promote to Production"
4. Confirm rollback

### Manual Rollback (Git)
```bash
# Find commit hash before pricing update
git log --oneline | head -5

# Revert to previous commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or hard reset (‚ö†Ô∏è dangerous)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push --force origin main
```

### Restore Old Environment Variables
```env
BASIC_PLAN_AMOUNT=2900
PRO_PLAN_AMOUNT=7900
ENTERPRISE_PLAN_AMOUNT=19900
```
