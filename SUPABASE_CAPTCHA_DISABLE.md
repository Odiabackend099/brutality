# URGENT: Disable Captcha in Supabase Dashboard

## The Problem
Your Supabase project still has captcha enabled, which is causing "captcha verification process failed" errors even though we removed all captcha code from the frontend.

## IMMEDIATE FIX - Do This Now:

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: "callwaitingai@gmail.com's Project"

### Step 2: Disable Captcha
1. Click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Attack Protection"** 
3. Find **"Enable Captcha protection"**
4. **TURN IT OFF** (toggle should be OFF)
5. Click **"Save changes"**

### Step 3: Test Immediately
1. Go to http://localhost:3005/login
2. Try to sign up with any email
3. Should work instantly without any captcha

## Why This Happens
- Supabase has captcha enabled at the database level
- Even with no captcha code in frontend, Supabase still requires it
- Disabling in dashboard = instant fix

## Alternative: If You Want to Keep Captcha
If you want captcha enabled, you need to:
1. Keep it enabled in Supabase
2. Add the captcha code back to frontend
3. Use the correct site key from Supabase

## RECOMMENDED: Disable Captcha
For fastest fix, just disable it in Supabase dashboard as shown above.
