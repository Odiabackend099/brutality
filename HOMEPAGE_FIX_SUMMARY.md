# Homepage User Flow Fix - Business Alignment

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Issue**: Homepage sending users to payment BEFORE free trial
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔴 Problem Identified

The homepage was **misaligned with your business objective**:

### What Was Wrong:
- ❌ All "Get Started" buttons went to Flutterwave payment ($300/$500)
- ❌ "Start Free Trial" buttons went to payment (not trial!)
- ❌ Users had to pay BEFORE trying the AI
- ❌ No path to dashboard/signup from homepage
- ❌ Violated your own messaging: "Free trial now, $300 setup after"

### Business Impact:
- **High friction**: Asking for payment before value demonstration
- **Low conversion**: Users won't pay without trying
- **Confused messaging**: Says "free trial" but links to payment
- **Lost leads**: Potential customers bounce without trying

---
