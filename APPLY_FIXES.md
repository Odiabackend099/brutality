# 🚀 QUICK START: Apply All Fixes

## ✅ All Code Fixes Applied!

Your code is now fixed. Just one database step remaining:

---

## 📋 Apply Database Schema (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard

Navigate to: **Your Project → SQL Editor**

### Step 2: Run the SQL Script

Copy the **entire contents** of this file:
```
sql/dashboard-tables.sql
```

Paste into SQL Editor and click **Run**

### Step 3: Verify

You should see success messages. Verify with:

```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('calls', 'leads');
```

Expected output:
```
table_name
----------
calls
leads
```

---

## 🎉 Done!

After running the SQL:

1. ✅ Dashboard will show stats
2. ✅ Calls page will work
3. ✅ Leads page will work
4. ✅ No more errors

---

## 🧪 Test It

1. Sign in: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. View dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
3. Check calls: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/calls`
4. Check leads: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/leads`

All pages should load without errors! 🚀

---

## 📝 What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Security** - Now using `getUser()` instead of `getSession()`
2. ✅ **Database Schema** - Added `calls` and `leads` tables
3. ✅ **Import Errors** - Fixed all `@/lib/auth` imports
4. ✅ **RLS Policies** - All tables secured
5. ✅ **Performance** - Indexes added

---

## 💡 Optional: Add Test Data

Want sample data? Run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Sample call
INSERT INTO calls (user_id, customer_phone, duration, status)
VALUES (auth.uid(), '+1234567890', 180, 'completed');

-- Sample lead
INSERT INTO leads (user_id, name, phone, source)
VALUES (auth.uid(), 'John Doe', '+1234567890', 'website');
```

Then refresh your dashboard!

**Ready to go!** Just run the SQL and you're all set. 🎊
