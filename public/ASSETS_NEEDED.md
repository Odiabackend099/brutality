# Missing Assets - Add These Files

Before deployment, you need to add these asset files:

## Required Files:

1. **`/public/og.jpg`**
   - Social media preview image (Open Graph)
   - Dimensions: 1200Ã—630 pixels
   - Format: JPG
   - Purpose: Shows when your site is shared on social media

2. **`/public/poster.jpg`**
   - Video poster frame (fallback image)
   - Dimensions: Match your video aspect ratio (recommended 16:9)
   - Format: JPG
   - Purpose: Shows before the video loads

3. **`/public/animations/ai-demo.mp4`**
   - Hero section demo video
   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (loop)
   - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
   - Size: Keep under 5MB for fast loading
   - Purpose: Shows your AI in action on the landing page

## Quick Actions:

- Create these with your InVideo account
- Or use placeholder images temporarily:
  - `og.jpg`: Screenshot of your landing page
  - `poster.jpg`: First frame of your video
  - `ai-demo.mp4`: Any demo recording

The site will build without these but won't look complete.
