## Critical Issues to Watch For

### üö® Authentication Errors
- Cookie not being set properly
- Session sync polling failing
- Middleware redirect loops
- OAuth callback failures

### üö® Payment Errors
- Flutterwave webhook signature validation failing
- Payment not reflecting in database
- Webhook not being received

### üö® API Errors
- 500 Internal Server Error from any endpoint
- Supabase connection failures
- OpenAI/MiniMax API failures

## Next Steps After Verification

1. **If all tests pass**:
   - [ ] Run TestSprite automated tests
   - [ ] Share production URL with stakeholders
   - [ ] Monitor error logs for 24 hours
   - [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (optional)

2. **If any tests fail**:
   - [ ] Note which specific test failed
   - [ ] Check Vercel function logs for that endpoint
   - [ ] Check browser console for client-side errors
   - [ ] Verify environment variable is set correctly
   - [ ] Report back with specific error messages

---

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

## Production URL

Once you verify the deployment URL, update this:

**Production URL**: `https://_____.vercel.app`

Replace this in:
- [ ] Vercel environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- [ ] Flutterwave webhook settings: `https://_____.vercel.app/api/flutterwave-webhook`
- [ ] Google OAuth redirect URIs (if using OAuth)
