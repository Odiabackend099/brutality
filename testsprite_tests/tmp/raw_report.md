## 2️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

#### Test TC001
- **Test Name:** Homepage Start Free Trial CTAs Navigation
- **Test Code:** [TC001_Homepage_Start_Free_Trial_CTAs_Navigation.py](./TC001_Homepage_Start_Free_Trial_CTAs_Navigation.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/7b611dda-0c79-47e9-88c3-61365fbdbf24/d77176e9-e773-49a1-8465-119ad5f3c822
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Analysis / Findings:** {{TODO:AI_ANALYSIS}}.
---

#### Test TC002
- **Test Name:** Homepage Absence of Direct Payment Links
- **Test Code:** [TC002_Homepage_Absence_of_Direct_Payment_Links.py](./TC002_Homepage_Absence_of_Direct_Payment_Links.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/7b611dda-0c79-47e9-88c3-61365fbdbf24/8765dc34-f467-4632-a924-0c8df92547dc
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Analysis / Findings:** {{TODO:AI_ANALYSIS}}.
---

#### Test TC003
- **Test Name:** Authentication Flow - Email/Password Signup and Login Without Payment
- **Test Code:** [TC003_Authentication_Flow___EmailPassword_Signup_and_Login_Without_Payment.py](./TC003_Authentication_Flow___EmailPassword_Signup_and_Login_Without_Payment.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/7b611dda-0c79-47e9-88c3-61365fbdbf24/ad2c1ef2-5abd-4a73-bd2d-0d920468e8ef
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Analysis / Findings:** {{TODO:AI_ANALYSIS}}.
---

#### Test TC004
- **Test Name:** Authentication Flow - Google OAuth Login Without Payment
- **Test Code:** [TC004_Authentication_Flow___Google_OAuth_Login_Without_Payment.py](./TC004_Authentication_Flow___Google_OAuth_Login_Without_Payment.py)
- **Test Error:** The Google OAuth authentication flow failed due to an invalid redirect URI configuration, resulting in an error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch. This prevents users from authenticating via Google OAuth and accessing the dashboard. No payment screen was encountered because login was not successful. The issue is a configuration problem that needs to be fixed by updating the redirect URI in the Google Cloud Console for the app. Task cannot proceed further until this is resolved.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/7b611dda-0c79-47e9-88c3-61365fbdbf24/d9ae6755-0d3a-42d3-9ddd-f4fa07de59e8
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Analysis / Findings:** {{TODO:AI_ANALYSIS}}.
---

#### Test TC005
- **Test Name:** Dashboard Accessibility During Free Trial
- **Test Code:** [TC005_Dashboard_Accessibility_During_Free_Trial.py](./TC005_Dashboard_Accessibility_During_Free_Trial.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/7b611dda-0c79-47e9-88c3-61365fbdbf24/175a9d57-8902-4bbe-94b4-056fd0b5d982
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Analysis / Findings:** {{TODO:AI_ANALYSIS}}.
---

#### Test TC006
- **Test Name:** Dashboard Sidebar 'Upgrade to Pro' Menu Item Presence and Styling
- **Test Code:** [TC006_Dashboard_Sidebar_Upgrade_to_Pro_Menu_Item_Presence_and_Styling.py](./TC006_Dashboard_Sidebar_Upgrade_to_Pro_Menu_Item_Presence_and_Styling.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify the 'Upgrade to Pro' menu item in the dashboard sidebar could not be completed because login failed due to invalid credentials. Without successful login, the dashboard and its sidebar menu are inaccessible, so presence, visibility, styling, and link verification of the 'Upgrade to Pro' menu item could not be performed.
Browser Console Logs:
[WARNING] [Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree. (at webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/next/dist/client/components/react-dev-overlay/app/hot-reloader-client.js:112:24)

[WARNING] [Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree. (at webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/next/dist/client/components/react-dev-overlay/app/hot-reloader-client.js:112:24)
