## ‚úÖ After Compression Checklist

Once you've compressed and replaced the video:

1. **Check the file size**:
   ```bash
   ls -lh public/animations/ai-demo.mp4
   ```
   Should show **3-5MB** instead of 47MB

2. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000 and verify:
   - ‚úÖ Video loads quickly
   - ‚úÖ Video plays smoothly
   - ‚úÖ Quality looks good

3. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Optimize video: reduce from 47MB to 3-5MB for faster loading"
   git push
   ```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Q: Video quality looks bad after compression?**
- Use CRF 23 instead of 28 (larger file, better quality)
- Or use "Medium Compression" instead of "Strong"

**Q: File is still too large?**
- Lower resolution to 960x540
- Increase CRF to 30-32
- Remove more frames (reduce FPS to 24)

**Q: Can't find the downloaded file?**
- Check your Downloads folder
- File might be named differently (rename it to `ai-demo.mp4`)
