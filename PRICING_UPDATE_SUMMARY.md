## Pricing Logic Reference

### Calculation Formula:
```typescript
const ratePerMinute = planAmount / planMinutes
const effectiveCost = minutesUsed * ratePerMinute
const remainingValue = (planMinutes - minutesUsed) * ratePerMinute
```

### Example (Pro Plan):
- Plan: $80 / 600 minutes = $0.14/min
- User uses 400 minutes: 400 × $0.14 = $56 consumed
- Remaining value: 200 × $0.14 = $28 (rolls over)
