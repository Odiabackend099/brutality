# CallWaiting AI Backend Deployment Guide

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

**The Supabase service_role key was exposed in the original plan. You MUST rotate it immediately before deployment.**

## ðŸ”’ Security Hardening Applied

This deployment includes production-level security measures:

- **HMAC-SHA256 Webhook Verification**: Proper cryptographic signature validation
- **Timestamp Freshness Checks**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Dangerous Node Blocking**: n8n configured to block risky operations
- **Server Hardening**: Firewall, fail2ban, automatic updates
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Security monitoring and incident response

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- VPS or server with Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Domain `n8n.odia.dev` pointing to your server (via DNS)
- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended) or Cloudflare SSL
- All required credentials ready (see env.example)

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment

### 1. Server Security Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Run server hardening script (Ubuntu/Debian)
./server-setup.sh

# This will configure:
# - Firewall (UFW)
# - Fail2ban intrusion detection
# - Automatic security updates
# - File integrity monitoring
# - Security monitoring scripts
```

### 2. Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone and navigate to the backend directory
cd callwaiting-backend

# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual values
nano .env
```

### 3. Deploy with Docker

```bash
# Start the stack
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f n8n-main
```

### 4. Configure SSL (if not using Cloudflare)

```bash
# Install certbot and get SSL certificate
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d n8n.odia.dev
```

### 5. Setup Supabase Database

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `db/supabase_schema_hardened.sql`
3. Enable PITR backups in Settings â†’ Database (Pro plan)

### 6. Import n8n Workflows

1. Access n8n at `https://n8n.odia.dev` (use Basic Auth from .env)
2. Import `n8n_workflows/payment_workflow_hardened.json`
3. Import `n8n_workflows/leads_workflow_cors.json`
4. Configure credentials:
   - Supabase (service role)
   - Flutterwave Bearer Token
   - Gmail SMTP

### 7. Configure Flutterwave

1. Go to Flutterwave Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Webhooks
2. Set webhook URL: `https://n8n.odia.dev/webhook/flutterwave`
3. Enable events: `charge.completed`, `transfer.completed`
4. Set secret hash and copy to `FLW_VERIF_HASH` in .env

### 8. Setup Cloudflare WAF (Optional but Recommended)

Create these rules in Cloudflare Dashboard:

**Rule 1: Block non-POST on payment webhook**
```
(http.request.uri.path contains "/webhook/flutterwave" and http.request.method ne "POST")
Action: Block
```

**Rule 2: Allow OPTIONS + POST for lead webhook**
```
(http.request.uri.path contains "/webhook/leads_callwaiting" and not http.request.method in {"POST" "OPTIONS"})
Action: Block
```

**Rule 3: Rate limiting**
```
Path: /webhook/*
Rate: 60 requests per minute per IP
Action: Block for 10 minutes
```

### 9. Email Deliverability

Set up SPF/DKIM/DMARC DNS records for your domain:

```dns
# SPF Record
TXT @ "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"

# DMARC Record
TXT _dmarc "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:callwaitingai@gmail.com"

# Enable DKIM in Google Workspace Admin Console
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Protocol

### Payment Flow Test
1. Make a $1 test payment via Flutterwave link
2. Verify webhook fires within 30 seconds
3. Check Supabase for payment record with `verified=true`
4. Confirm customer receives email with Calendly link
5. Confirm founder receives alert email
6. Test duplicate webhook (should not create duplicate record)

### Lead Form Test
1. Submit lead form from browser
2. Verify CORS preflight passes
3. Check Supabase for lead record
4. Confirm founder receives lead alert
5. Test form validation and error handling

### Security Test
1. Send webhook with wrong `verif-hash` â†’ should be rejected
2. Try non-POST requests to webhooks â†’ should be blocked
3. Test rate limiting â†’ should block after 60 requests/minute
4. Verify emails land in inbox (not spam)

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Maintenance

### Logs
```bash
# View n8n logs
docker-compose logs -f n8n-main

# View all services
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Backups
- Enable PITR backups in Supabase (Pro plan)
- Regular database exports: `pg_dump` from postgres container
- n8n workflow exports: Download from n8n interface

### Updates
```bash
# Update n8n
docker-compose pull n8n-main n8n-worker
docker-compose up -d

# Update all services
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Webhook Timeouts**
- Check n8n logs for execution errors
- Verify "Respond to Webhook" node is early in flow
- Ensure queue mode is working (Redis connected)

**CORS Errors**
- Verify Cloudflare allows OPTIONS for lead webhook
- Check n8n webhook CORS headers in workflow

**Email in Spam**
- Set up SPF/DKIM/DMARC for domain
- Use domain email sender, not Gmail
- Test with external email addresses

**Duplicate Payments**
- Verify unique constraint on `flutterwave_id` in Supabase
- Check idempotency in Supabase upsert operation

**Failed Signatures**
- Verify `FLW_VERIF_HASH` matches Flutterwave dashboard
- Check webhook payload structure in n8n logs

**Database Connection Issues**
- Check postgres container is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Verify credentials in .env file
- Check Supabase service key is rotated and correct
