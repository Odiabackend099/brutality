## ðŸ’° Cost Considerations

### OpenAI Pricing (GPT-4o-mini)

**Estimated cost: < $0.001 per chat interaction**

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### OpenAI Node Fails

**Error: "Invalid API key"**
- Check credentials are saved correctly

**Error: "Rate limit exceeded"**

- Add rate limiting or upgrade OpenAI plan

### MiniMax TTS Fails

**Error: "Unauthorized"**
