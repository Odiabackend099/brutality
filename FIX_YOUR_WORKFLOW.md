# 🔧 Fix Your Current n8n Workflow

## 🔍 **Issues Found**

Your workflow has syntax errors in two nodes:

### **1. Extract Input Node**

**Current (WRONG):**
```
chatInput: "=={{ $json.body.message"     ❌ Missing }}"
messageType: "=`={{ $json.body.type"     ❌ Has backtick, missing }}"
```

**Should be:**
```
chatInput: "={{ $json.body.message }}"   ✅
messageType: "={{ $json.body.type }}"    ✅
```

### **2. Extract AI Response Node**

**Current (WRONG):**
```
aiResponseText: "=`={{ $json.data?.content"  ❌ Wrong path
```

**Should be:**
```
aiResponseText: "={{ $json.output }}"        ✅
```

The AI Agent node outputs `$json.output`, not `$json.data.content`

## ✅ **Quick Fix Option 1: Import Fixed Workflow**

I've created a corrected version of your workflow:

1. **Go to n8n:** https://callwaitingai.app.n8n.cloud

2. **Deactivate your current workflow**

3. **Import the fixed version:**
   - File: `n8n-workflow-your-fixed.json`
   - This has all your nodes with syntax errors corrected

4. **Activate** the workflow

5. **Test:**
   ```bash
   node test-webhook.js "What is CallWaiting AI?"
   ```

1. Open your workflow in n8n
2. Click on **"Extract Input"** node
3. Click on the **chatInput** field
4. Change from: `=={{ $json.body.message`
5. Change to: `={{ $json.body.message }}`
6. Click on the **messageType** field
7. Change from: `=\`={{ $json.body.type`
8. Change to: `={{ $json.body.type }}`

### **Step 2: Fix Extract AI Response Node**

1. Click on **"Extract AI Response"** node
2. Click on the **aiResponseText** field
3. Change from: `=\`={{ $json.data?.content`
4. Change to: `={{ $json.output }}`

### **Step 3: Fix Validate Message Code**

1. Click on **"Validate Message"** node
2. In the code, change the return statement:
3. From: `return $json;`
4. To: `return [$json];`

### **Step 4: Save and Test**

## 🧪 **Expected Result After Fix**

```bash
✅ Valid JSON Response:
{
  "text": "Hello! I'm doing great, thank you for asking! I'm CallWaiting AI...",
  "audio_url": "https://..."
}

🎉 Webhook test PASSED!
```

## 🎯 **What Each Node Does**

Your workflow is really well structured! Here's the flow:

```
1. Webhook Trigger
   ↓ Receives: { body: { message: "...", type: "text" } }

2. Extract Input
   ↓ Extracts: { chatInput: "...", messageType: "text" }

3. Validate Message
   ↓ Checks if message is empty, adds default if needed

4. AI Agent (with OpenAI + Memory)
   ↓ Generates: { output: "AI response..." }

5. Extract AI Response
   ↓ Extracts: { aiResponseText: "AI response..." }

6. MiniMax TTS
   ↓ Generates: { audio_file: "https://..." }

7. Format Response
   ↓ Creates: { text: "...", audio_url: "..." }

8. Respond to Webhook
   ↓ Returns JSON to chat widget
```

## 🚀 **After You Fix It**

### **Test the Workflow:**

```bash
# Test 1: Simple greeting

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Improve AI Responses**

In the **AI Agent** node, you can customize the system message:

**Current:**
```
You are CallWaiting AI — a warm, helpful voice assistant...
```

**For more personality:**
```
You are CallWaiting AI, the most helpful AI receptionist on the planet!
You're enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and love helping businesses grow.
Keep responses conversational and under 80 words so they sound natural
when spoken aloud.
```

### **Add Tools to AI Agent**

You can connect tools to the AI Agent:
- Calculator
- Web search
- Database lookup
- API calls

This lets the AI perform actions, not just chat!

### **Optimize MiniMax TTS**

For faster responses:
- Reduce `sample_rate` to 16000 (lower quality, faster)
- Use `bitrate`: 64000 (smaller files)

For better quality:
- Keep `sample_rate`: 24000
- Use `bitrate`: 192000
