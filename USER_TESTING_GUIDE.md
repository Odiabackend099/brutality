---

## 🧪 How to Test as a Business User

### Step 1: Access the Homepage

**URL**: http://localhost:3002 (or your Vercel deployment)

**What to Check**:
- [ ] Page loads quickly
- [ ] Video plays automatically (your AI demo)
- [ ] "Log In" button visible (top right)
- [ ] "Start Free Trial" button visible (top right)
- [ ] "Call Ada" section with phone number +1 (415) 687-6510
- [ ] Chat widget bubble visible (bottom right)
- [ ] Pricing shows "FREE TRIAL FIRST" badges
- [ ] All CTAs say "Start Free Trial" (not "Pay $300")

**Expected Result**: ✅ Clean, professional homepage with clear free trial messaging

---

### Step 2: Test the Chat Widget (Current State)

**Action**: Click the chat bubble (bottom right)

**What to Check**:
- [ ] Chat window opens smoothly
- [ ] See "CallWaiting AI" header
- [ ] Two tabs: "Text" and "Voice"
- [ ] Text input box visible
- [ ] Send button enabled

**Try Sending a Text Message**:
1. Type: "What are your business hours?"
2. Press Enter or click Send

**Current Behavior**:
- ❌ **Will show error** because webhook is not deployed yet
- ❌ Message will timeout or show "Failed to get response"

**Why**: The Supabase Edge Function (`webhook-proxy`) is not deployed. The chat widget is trying to reach:
```
https://bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd.supabase.co/functions/v1/webhook-proxy
```

But this endpoint doesn't exist yet until you deploy it.

---

### Step 3: Sign Up for Free Trial

**Action**: Click "Start Free Trial" button

**What Happens**:
1. Redirects to `/login` page
2. See "Sign Up" form with:
   - Full Name field
   - Email field
   - Password field
   - Company field (optional)
   - "Create Account" button
   - "Sign in with Google" button
   - Link to switch to "Sign In" mode

**Try It**:
```
Full Name: John Doe
Email: john@example.com
Password: TestPassword123!
Company: Acme Corp
```

**Current Behavior**:
- ⏳ **Will show "Account created!"** message
- ⏳ **But email won't send** because Supabase email provider is not enabled
- ⏳ User account is created in database but can't verify email

**What Should Happen** (when configured):
1. Account created ✅
2. Verification email sent to john@example.com
3. User clicks link in email
4. Redirected to dashboard
5. Can start using free trial

---

### Step 4: Try to Access Dashboard (Current State)

**Action**: After "signup", navigate to `/dashboard`

**Current Behavior**:
- ⏳ Will redirect to `/login` because email is not verified
- ⏳ Can't access dashboard without email verification

**Workaround for Testing**:
If you enable Supabase Auth and verify your email, you'll be able to access:

**Dashboard Features**:
- [ ] Main dashboard with stats (calls, revenue, leads)
- [ ] Usage quota displays (API calls, tokens, TTS chars)
- [ ] Call Logs page (empty initially)
- [ ] Payments page (empty initially)
- [ ] Leads page (empty initially)
- [ ] Settings page (update profile, change password)
- [ ] **NEW: "Upgrade to Pro"** menu item (goes to payment page)

---

### Step 5: Test the Upgrade/Payment Page

**Action**: From dashboard sidebar, click "Upgrade to Pro"

**URL**: `/dashboard/upgrade`

**What to Check**:
- [ ] See "Ready to Launch?" header
- [ ] Two pricing cards: Starter ($300) and Pro ($500)
- [ ] "MOST POPULAR" badge on Pro plan
- [ ] "Pay $300 & Launch" button (Starter)
- [ ] "Pay $500 & Launch Pro" button (Pro)
- [ ] FAQ section explaining what happens after payment
- [ ] Stats cards: 48hrs, 24/7, 100% guarantee

**Click Payment Button**:
- Opens Flutterwave payment page
- Enter payment details
- Complete transaction
- **After payment**: Team will contact you within 2 hours to setup

## ⚙️ What YOU Need to Configure

To make the AI Agent actually work, you need to complete these steps:

### 1. Deploy Supabase Edge Function ⏳

**What**: The security layer that validates requests and forwards to n8n

**How**:
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link your project
supabase link --project-ref bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd

# Deploy the webhook proxy
supabase functions deploy webhook-proxy

# Set environment secrets
supabase secrets set WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-secret-here"
supabase secrets set N8N_WEBHOOK_URL="your-n8n-webhook-url"
```

**File**: `supabase/functions/webhook-proxy/index.ts`

---

### 2. Generate Webhook Secret ⏳

**What**: Secret key for HMAC signature validation

**How**:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

**Copy the output** and set it in:
- Supabase: `supabase secrets set WEBHOOK_SECRET="..."`
- Vercel: Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable
- Local: Update `.env.local` file

---

### 3. Enable Supabase Authentication ⏳

**What**: Email verification and user management

**How**:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd
2. Navigate to Authentication → Providers
3. Enable "Email" provider
4. Set Site URL: `https://your-domain.com`
5. Set Redirect URLs: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback`
6. Customize email templates (optional)
7. Enable Google OAuth (optional)

---

### 4. Configure n8n Workflow ⏳

**What**: The automation that connects to OpenAI and Minimax

**Status**: You already have n8n Cloud account

**What to Check**:
- [ ] n8n workflow is active
- [ ] Webhook URL is correct
- [ ] OpenAI API key is set
- [ ] Minimax API key is set
- [ ] Response format matches expected:
```json
{
  "text": "AI response here",
  "audio_url": "https://...",
  "status": "success"
}
```

---

### 5. Update Vercel Environment Variables ⏳

**Add these to Vercel**:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL=https://bcufohulqrceytkrqpgd.supabase.co/functions/v1/webhook-proxy
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-generated-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_NAME=CallWaiting AI
NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDLY_LINK=https://calendly.com/callwaitingai/30min
```

---

## 📱 Testing the Voice AI (When Configured)

### Text Message Test:

**Send**: "What services do you offer?"

**Expected AI Response** (from n8n):
```
We offer AI-powered voice assistants for businesses.
Our AI can handle calls, respond to messages, and
book appointments 24/7. Would you like to learn more?
```

### Voice Message Test:

1. Click "Voice" tab in chat widget
2. Click microphone button
3. Speak: "What are your business hours?"
4. Release button

**Expected AI Response**:
- Text transcript displayed in chat
- Audio playback button appears

## 🎤 How the Voice AI Agent Works

### Architecture:

```
User Types/Speaks in Chat Widget
        ↓
Frontend (Next.js)
        ↓
HMAC Signature Generated
        ↓
Request sent to Supabase Edge Function (webhook-proxy)
        ↓
Edge Function validates HMAC signature
        ↓
Edge Function checks rate limit (Redis)
        ↓
Edge Function forwards to n8n Webhook
        ↓
n8n Workflow:
  → Receives message
  → Sends to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (text response)
  → Sends text to Minimax TTS (voice generation)
  → Returns JSON with text + audio URL
        ↓
Response flows back through Edge Function
        ↓
Frontend displays text + plays audio
        ↓
Chat message saved to Supabase (call_logs table)
        ↓
Visible in Dashboard "Call Logs" page
```

### Example n8n Workflow Response:

```json
{
  "text": "Hi! I'm Ada, your AI assistant. How can I help you today?",
  "audio_url": "https://minimax-cdn.com/audio/12345.mp3",
  "duration_ms": 1250,
  "tokens_used": 45,
  "tts_chars": 62,
  "status": "success"
}
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Chat widget shows "Failed to get response"

**Cause**: Edge Function not deployed or n8n workflow not running

**Fix**:
1. Deploy Edge Function: `supabase functions deploy webhook-proxy`
2. Check n8n workflow is active
3. Verify webhook URL in environment variables

---

### Issue: "Email verification required" banner won't go away

**Cause**: Supabase email provider not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication
2. Enable Email provider
3. Click verification link in email
4. Refresh dashboard

---

### Issue: Can't sign up - "Error creating account"

**Cause**: Supabase auth not configured properly

**Fix**:
1. Check Supabase URL and anon key in `.env.local`
2. Verify Supabase project is active
3. Check browser console for error details

---

### Issue: Payment button doesn't work

**Cause**: Flutterwave link might be inactive

**Fix**:
1. Go to `/dashboard/upgrade` page
2. Verify Flutterwave links:
   - Starter: https://flutterwave.com/pay/tcasx4xsfmdj
   - Pro: https://flutterwave.com/pay/vcpp9rpmnvdm
3. Test in incognito window

---

### Issue: Voice recording doesn't work

**Cause**: Browser doesn't have microphone permission

**Fix**:
1. Browser will prompt for microphone access
2. Click "Allow"
3. Check browser settings → Site permissions → Microphone
4. Try HTTPS (voice recording requires secure context)

---
