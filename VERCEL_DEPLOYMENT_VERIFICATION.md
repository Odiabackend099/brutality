## üéØ What You Should See vs What You Had

```
Headline: "Stop losing carts to slow replies.
           Your AI answers TikTok DMs and Calls in seconds."

Subheadline: "Chat, book, and follow up in a real human voice..."

CTA: "Start Free Trial"
```

### NEW Homepage (After):
```
Headline: "Let AI Answer Your Calls
           When You Can't"

Subheadline: "Never miss a lead, client, or customer.
              Our voice AI picks up, speaks clearly,
              and gets the job done‚Äîeven when you're busy."

CTAs: "Get Early Access" + "Try Live Demo"
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Problem: "I still see the old page"
**Solution:** Clear browser cache or use incognito mode

### Problem: "Vercel says 'Building...' for more than 5 minutes"
**Solution:** Check build logs for errors, may need to cancel and redeploy

### Problem: "Build failed"
**Solution:** Build passes locally, so this shouldn't happen. Contact Vercel support.

### Problem: "Changes appear on Vercel URL but not custom domain"
**Solution:** DNS propagation delay. Wait 5-10 minutes and try again.

### Problem: "Some changes appear but not others"
**Solution:** This is browser cache. Do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

## üìû Quick Verification Commands

```

### Push again if needed:
