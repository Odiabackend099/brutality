## ⚠️ Issues Found (2 Minor)

### 🔴 Issue #1: Health Check Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/health`  
**Severity**: 🟡 Medium  
**Status**: Failed

**Description**: Health check endpoint returns unexpected response format.

**Expected**: 
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T08:31:40Z"
}
```

**Actual**: Response doesn't match expected format

**Impact**: 
- Monitoring tools may not work correctly
- Load balancers may fail health checks
- Not critical for end-user functionality

**Recommendation**: 
1. Check `/app/api/health/route.ts`
2. Ensure it returns `{ status: "ok" }` with 200 status
3. Add timestamp field
4. Test with `curl https://www.callwaitingai.dev/api/health`

**Fix Priority**: 🟡 Medium (fix within 24 hours)

---

### 🔴 Issue #2: Session Endpoint Method
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/auth/session`  
**Severity**: 🟢 Low  
**Status**: Failed

**Description**: Session endpoint returns 405 Method Not Allowed for GET requests.

**Expected**: Returns session data or 401 for unauthenticated users

**Actual**: Returns 405 (Method Not Allowed)

**Impact**:
- May indicate endpoint expects POST instead of GET
- Client-side code might need adjustment
- Doesn't affect authentication flow if handled properly

**Recommendation**:
1. Verify if endpoint should accept GET or POST
2. Check Next.js API route configuration
3. Update client code if needed
4. Ensure consistent method across app

**Fix Priority**: 🟢 Low (fix within 1 week)
